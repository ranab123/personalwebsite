      <h2>Attention is the Most Valuable Currency</h2>

      <p>I used to hear the phrase “pay attention” all the time when I was younger. To be fair, I was paying attention… just not to the things my parents or teachers wanted (I had a penchant for daydreaming). Although it’s been a while since I’ve heard those words, the demand for my attention has only increased since then. I can’t open my phone without seeing a million notifications vying for my attention and I can’t step outside without seeing a billboard doing the same thing. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The amount of information available at the tip of our fingers has exponentially increased and, as a result, the increased supply of information has inversely created a scarcity of attention.

<p>As explained by political scientist Herbert Simon: </p>
      <blockquote>
        “[I]n an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a death of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.” 
      </blockquote>

     <h4>How do Companies Win Your Attention? 
    </h4>
      
    <ol>
        <li><strong>They Know You (Possibly Better Than Yourself):</strong> It’s why TikTok’s algorithm is so addictive. They collect such an abundance of data that they literally might know you better than yourself. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>They Pass Your RAS Filter: Your Reticular Activation System is the part of our brain that acts as a filter for incoming sensory information. It prioritizes bringing information important to survival and well-being to your attention. The deeper a company understands you, the better they’re able to A) (ideally) build a product that truly adds value, which B) passes the RAS filter. </li>
            <li><strong>Strategic Ad Placement:</strong> An ad for walking canes</strong> on Snapchat probably won’t be very useful to anyone. Similarly, an ad for Kylie Jenner’s newest lip liner in the newspaper won’t be super useful either. Volume is equally as crucial. The Marketing Rule of 7 states that a potential customer needs to see a message at least 7 times before they'll be compelled to take an action. It’s why it feels like you see the same ad a million times. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>Disrupting the Pattern:</strong> Humans are hardwired to notice pattern disruptions. An ad that makes you stop and think, “WTF is this???” accomplishes this perfectly. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>Sticky Products:</strong> Sarah Tavel’s “Hierarchy of Engagement” provides a great structure for this. You should read the full framework, but the TLDR is that products with virtuous loops of engagement are hard to leave. 
    </li>
    </ol>
