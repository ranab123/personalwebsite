      <h2>How to Engineer a Good Day</h2>

      <p>You know those people who <b><em>always</em></b> seem to be having a great day? The ones you’ve <em>never</em> seen upset, stressed, or tired. People whose brains seem like they’re powered by an infinite supply of sunshine, rainbows, sparkles, and glitter. 
    </p>
    <p>I’ve always wondered how they do it. Even though I realize that <em>always</em> being <em>that</em> happy is an unrealistic goal, I’ve found a few strategies that consistently work to optimize for a good day. 
    </p>
    <p>The secret? Priming your brain in the morning. </p>

    <p>Here's my running list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Get a good night’s sleep (very important). 
        </li>
        <li>Wake up and listen to “Another Day Of Sun.” Game-changing. 
        </li>
        <li>Positive mindset (most important): 
            <ul>
                <li>Think about everything you’re grateful for. 
                </li>
                <li>Know there’s no problem you can’t get through. 
                </li>
                <li>Remember <a href="https://medium.com/finn-jackson/the-parable-of-the-taoist-farmer-8f52bba7f12c" target=”_blank”>this story.</a> 
                </li>
                <li>Advice Aloe Blacc shared with me: Don't sweat the small stuff. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Exercise and/or meditate. </li>
        <li>Cold shower. 
        </li>
        <li>Stay hydrated. 
        </li>
        <li>If all else fails: take vitamin B. 
        </li>
    </ul>
