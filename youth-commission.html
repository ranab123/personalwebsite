        <div> <p><strong>Process:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Realized my city lacked a structure for young people to formally share their thoughts and opinions with city leaders. 
</li>
          <li>Worked with my friend, Nithya, to lead a group of students to advocate for it. 
</li>
          <li>Wrote a city resolution and worked with the mayor and the city council to <a href="https://www.modbee.com/news/local/education/article256805517.html" target=”_blank”>implement it.</a>  
</li>
          <li> Unsurprisingly, the process was much longer and more drawn-out than I just described (took a couple of years), thanks to bureaucracy and politics.
</li>
        </ul></p></div>
