        <h4>Hi, I'm Rana 👋</h4>
        <p>I’m an undergrad at Stanford studying Product Design and Management Science. I also invest with <a href="https://roughdraft.vc/" target=”_blank”>Rough Draft Ventures.</a></p>

        <p>I'm passionate about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Experimenting:</strong> Talking to strangers has taught me that:
            <ol>
              <li>Everyone has a unique story to tell. </li>
              <li>Everyone can teach you something new.</li>
              <li>Everyone wants authentic connection with others. </li>
            </ol>

            Ironically, despite the abundance of connective technologies, #3 is the least realized. My friend, Delali, and I have been experimenting with ways to solve this through carefully designed gatherings. 

          </li>
          <li> <strong>Exploring:</strong> I want to explore as much as humanly possible within my lifetime. Both physical exploration (i.e. exploring new countries, cities, holes in the wall) and intellectual exploration (i.e. learning new things, meeting new people). Curiosity is the best compass. Follow it. 
 
  </li>
          <li> <strong>Entreprenuership:</strong> I used to think the best way to effect meaningful change was through policy. I’ve since realized that bureaucracy is not only too slow, but politicians have misaligned incentives. Entrepreneurs have a far greater ability to swiftly change the world.  </li>
          <li> <strong>Philosophy:</strong> Currently exploring Buddhism and Zen philosophy.  </li>
        </ul>
        <p> In my free time, I enjoy <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/u/froggiewrld" target=”_blank”>playing guitar,</a> running, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/ranaba" target=”_blank”>reading,</a> <a href="https://ranab.substack.com/" target=”_blank”>writing</a>, and <a href="./projects.html">tinkering</a>. </p>

        <h4>Previously:</h4>
        <p>I dove deep into Education Policy, focusing on finding solutions for structural flaws within the education system and <a href="https://www.modbee.com/news/economic-mobility-lab/article254437433.html" target=”_blank”>rebounding from the pandemic</a>. After being appointed by <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/05/28/governor-newsom-announces-appointments-5-28-21/" target=”_blank”>Governor Newsom</a> and being senate-confirmed, I served on the State Board of Education as a <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2022/04/21/teenage-girl-students-state-boards-education/" target=”_blank”>voting</a> member representing California’s 6 million students. 
<br>
<br>    
Concurrently, I served as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MCS4kids/posts/5158929544162218/?paipv=0&eav=AfbsaJc8kwWYYuGSLkSSpgD-_ZU8-nJR-m-eN2ZVn608wCbRB66VhWQbTbB7K1adZ28&_rdr" target=”_blank”>Student Board Member</a> of my school district, representing 30,000 students. I also co-hosted a few webinars alongside leaders like <a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/%EF%BF%BCsenator-padilla-secretary-cardona-highlight-efforts-to-address-mental-health-pandemic-impacts-on-californias-k-12-students/" target=”_blank”>Secretary Cardona</a> and <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/nr/ne/yr21/yr21rel56.asp" target=”_blank”>Dolores Huerta</a> and helped write and advocate for bills as the National Legislative Advisor of <a href="https://www.generationup.net/board-of-directors" target=”_blank”> GenerationUp</a>. 
<br>
<br>
I explored my love of writing by contributing to the local paper, founding a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modesto-High-School-Literary-Magazine/dp/1095488554" target=”_blank”>literary magazine</a> club, and serving as Vice President of the <a href="https://www.sjvalleywriters.org/" target=”_blank”>San Joaquin Valley Writers</a> club.
